Retature day 2 Notes

Git bash structure:
[command] [arguments, options/flags]
   Dotnet      new console     -l
   Ls			        ( -o, --output) (folder-name)
   Git			--help

Absolute vs relative paths
c:/ revature/helloWorld/project vs /helloWorld/project

Space separates arguments, if need a space use “quotes” eg. “ My New Folder”
Double quotes: tell bash to pass on the spaces to the underlying command
~ means home directory
. means current directory
.. means parent directory

Commands:
	cd <dir>
		Change directory, can be absolute or relative
